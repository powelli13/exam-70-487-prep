When declaring a SqlCommand on its own you must set the Connection property of the command so it uses the correct connection

set the CommandType of the SqlCommand to StoredProcedure if appropriate

binding redirect tag in Web.config file takes oldVersion and redirects to newVersion specified for the assemblyIdentity tag's referenced assembly
these tags go in a dependentAssembly tag

Add-BindingRedirect and Update-Package powershell commands work in a development environment not a production one

the codeBase element of Web.config specifies where the CLR can find a specific assembly version, needs an href attribute

for a TFS build server:
- Rolling Builds as a trigger will not queue another build while one is in progress
	rolling allows for a period of time to wait before starting another build
	period of time prevents final build from being delayed by a number of queued builds
- Continuous Integration queues a build for each check in
- Scheduled build will build at a specified time of day
- Gated Check-in will prevent check-ins that had failed builds

- when using LINQ to Entities format is "from .. where .. select;" 
	- use && to join logical pieces of the where clause
	- use "from x in blah select x;" to select all
	- use .Value to get the value of a nullable type

- Serializable transaction isolation level will not allow updates or inserts to data that can affect a read query,
	will guarantee same read results for two selects in a transaction

- isolation levels:
READ UNCOMMITTED
Specifies that statements can read rows that have been modified by other transactions but not yet committed.
READ COMMITTED
Specifies that statements cannot read data that has been modified but not committed by other transactions. SQL server default.
REPEATABLE READ
Specifies that statements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions and that no other
transactions can modify data that has been read by the current transaction until the current transaction completes.
Will read new data whereas SERIALIZABLE will not.
SNAPSHOT
Specifies that data read by any statement in a transaction will be the transactionally consistent version of the data that existed at the start of the transaction.
SERIALIZABLE
Statements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions.
No other transactions can modify data that has been read by the current transaction until the current transaction completes.
Other transactions cannot insert new rows with key values that would fall in the range of keys read by any statements in the
current transaction until the current transaction completes.

- use Azure Blob Storage for large unstructured over HTTP or HTTPS, use this for an Access database

- ASP.NET Application and Cache objects live in memory

- HttpContext.Current.Cache.Insert can be used to create caches that track files, requires an absolute path to the file that 
will be tracked. Server.MapPath can convert a virtual path to an absolute one.

- protocol for an EventHubs namespace is sb, hostname is the company namespace, and in a connection string Endpoint and EntityPath are required

- Database property of the DbContext class represents the underlying db, the Log property is Action<string> delegate that logs commands executed and the time it took

- Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer solution that allows routing traffic based on URLs

- in Azure API Management Gateway every API must be part of a product before you can invoke operations

- Transform, Locator and Match attributes can be added to transform Web.configs when releasing to different environments

- in Web.config > httpProtocols > customHeaders is where to add Access-Control-Allow-* names with values denoting which Origin, Methods and Headers to allow access to an API

- for a SqlConnectionStringBuilder: DataSource is the SQL Server instance, InitialCatalog is the name of the database

- If the .edmx file's build action is EntityDeploy then the .csdl, .ssdl and .msl files will be included as embedded resources and the EntityConnectionStringBuilder.Metadata property will need to be set

- in ADO.NET DataReader provides read only access and will be faster than DataSet and DataAdapter (which allow modification)

- Stored Procedures are faster than Dynamic SQL Expressions

- Single throws an exception if there is more than 1

- First will force execution just like ToList and ToArray

- Take(n) will allow for deferred execution and will only take n not more than that

- LINQ to XML easily parses an XML document in preparation for storage in a SQL Server database

- when using a SqlCommand set the .Connection property to tell which SqlConnection to use, also set the .CommandType as needed

- WCF Data Services uses Open Data (OData)

- Web API uses REST semantics

- Web API default actoin selector allows Post, Put, Get, Delete to determine behavior for methods with that in the start of the name and not require an attribute
Ensure this is up to date with v2

- for a .NET component consumed by ASP.NET register in GAC, for COM clients register in Windows Registry using Regasm.exe or Regsvr32.exe

- Add-Migration and Update-Database PowerShell commands generate code needed to update the database on a code first approach

- working directory in the project's properties should be the project root directory in order to find the database in a code first approach

- by default Web API matches the action method name prefix with the HTTP verb

- CORS must be enabled on both the web app client in the HttpConfiguration class and as an attribute on the Web API controller

- in API Management: each gateway must have a unique URL and each API in a gateway must have a unique endpoint

- revision of an API requires rev=# parameter

- HTTP header value can be used for API version to control access without changing the URL

- if a route prefix attribute is specified for a controller class the prefix is not needed on route attributes of the actions

- regex can be applied to the {parameters} in route attributes

- the Web Deployment Agent should be on the server running IIS in TFS

- a .cmd or .bat file can be used to deploy an application after it is built in TFS 

- swapping the Virtual IPs (VIPs) for the staging and production environments can reduce downtime after deploying to staging

- Azure Compute Emulator hosts Windows Azure roles on a development computer

- IDataServiceActionProvider interface should be implemented to advertised methods as service actions on entities in WCF

- WebGet or WebInvoke attributes can be applied to service operations in WCF

- one TransactionScope can make statements against two different databases act as a single transaction

- HttpContext.Current.Cache.Insert("name", object, new CacheDependency("filetomonitor.xml")); can be used to create an item in the ASP.NET cache that will be invalidated if the dependecy changes

- the HttpCachePolicy class implements page output caching, not data caching

- each server in Azure File Sync represents a server endpoint that will synchronize with the cloud endpoint, a cloud endpoint represents one file share in Azure

- the Include method in EF allows you to eagerly load a related entity
